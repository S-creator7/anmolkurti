# Testing the AccountManagement Fix

## What was fixed:
1. **Categories Array**: Updated to use `dynamicFilters?.category` from the new FilterContext with a fallback array
2. **Products Mapping**: Added `Array.isArray(products)` safety check before mapping
3. **Image Safety**: Added optional chaining `product.image?.[0]` with fallback to prevent image errors

## How to test:

### 1. Start the application:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Admin Frontend
cd admin
npm run dev
```

### 2. Initialize filters (if not done already):
- Go to admin panel
- Navigate to "Filter Management" tab
- Click "Initialize Defaults" button
- This will create the necessary filter structure

### 3. Test the Products tab:
- Navigate to "Products" tab in Account Management
- The page should load without the map error
- Try:
  - Searching for products
  - Filtering by category
  - Sorting products
  - All operations should work without errors

### 4. Add some test products:
- Go to "Add Product" tab
- Add a few products to populate the list
- Return to "Products" tab to verify they display correctly

### 5. If you still see errors:
- Check browser console for any remaining errors
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache if needed

## Expected behavior:
- No "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" errors
- Products tab loads successfully
- Category dropdown shows available categories
- All product operations work smoothly

## If issues persist:
The fix addresses the immediate mapping error. If you encounter other issues, they may be related to:
- API connectivity
- Missing product data
- Other undefined objects in the component
