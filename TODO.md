# Scroll Position Preservation Implementation Plan

## Problem
When clicking on a product from the collections page, the product page opens but when clicking the back arrow button, it goes to the top of the collections page instead of staying at the product that was clicked.

## Root Cause
The `ProductItem` component had an `onClick` handler that called `scrollTo(0, 0)` when navigating to a product page, which scrolled to the top and lost the scroll position.

## Solution Steps

1. [x] Remove the `scrollTo(0, 0)` call from the `ProductItem` component's `Link` onClick handler
2. [x] Implement scroll position preservation in `ProductList.jsx` using:
   - `sessionStorage` to save scroll position before navigation
   - `useEffect` to restore scroll position when component mounts
3. [ ] Test the functionality to ensure scroll position is preserved

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/ProductItem.jsx` - Removed scrollTo call
- `frontend/src/pages/ProductList.jsx` - Added scroll position preservation logic

## Implementation Details

### ProductItem.jsx Changes:
- Removed `onClick={() => scrollTo(0, 0)}` from the Link component

### ProductList.jsx Changes:
- Added scroll position save before navigation using click event listeners on product links
- Added scroll position restore on component mount using requestAnimationFrame
- Used sessionStorage to persist scroll position across navigation

## Testing
- Navigate to collections page
- Scroll down and click on a product
- Click browser back button
- Verify scroll position is preserved
